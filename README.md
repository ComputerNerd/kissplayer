### A Simple and Lightweight Music Player [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/andreldm/kissplayer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/andreldm/kissplayer)

Cross-platform and open-source Music Player designed to be simple and lightweight.
If you want a player full of features, most of them you don't use, exaggerated eye-candy and a memory hog, take a look around , there are lots. However if you want a different player that doesn't distract you or wastes your time, KISS Player can be a great alternative.

As of now, it's alpha, usable, but lacks some minor features and needs more polishing. Suggestions and contributions are welcome.

Note: The name has nothing to do with the metal band or the act of kissing. It's an acronym for "Keep it simple, stupid" principle.
